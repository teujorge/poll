      <p>
        <strong>Acknowledgement:</strong> You and Pollist acknowledge that these
        Terms are concluded between you and Pollist only, and not with Apple,
        and that Pollist, not Apple, is solely responsible for the Licensed
        Application and the content thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope of License:</strong> The license granted to you for the
        Licensed Application is limited to a non-transferable license to use the
        Licensed Application on any Apple-branded Products that you own or
        control and as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media
        Services Terms and Conditions, except that such Licensed Application may
        be accessed and used by other accounts associated with you via Family
        Sharing or volume purchasing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Maintenance and Support:</strong> Pollist is solely responsible
        for providing any maintenance and support services with respect to the
        Licensed Application, as specified in these Terms, or as required under
        applicable law. You and Pollist acknowledge that Apple has no obligation
        whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect
        to the Licensed Application.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Warranty:</strong> Pollist is solely responsible for any product
        warranties, whether express or implied by law, to the extent not
        effectively disclaimed. In the event of any failure of the Licensed
        Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple,
        and Apple will refund the purchase price for the Licensed Application to
        you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have
        no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Licensed
        Application, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs
        or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will
        be Pollist&apos;s sole responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Product Claims:</strong> Pollist and you acknowledge that
        Pollist, not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims of you or
        any third party relating to the Licensed Application or your possession
        and/or use of that Licensed Application, including, but not limited to:
        (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the Licensed
        Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory
        requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection,
        privacy, or similar legislation, including in connection with the
        Licensed Application&apos;s use of the HealthKit and HomeKit frameworks.
        The EULA may not limit Pollist&apos;s liability to you beyond what is
        permitted by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Intellectual Property Rights:</strong> You and Pollist
        acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the
        Licensed Application or your possession and use of that Licensed
        Application infringes that third party&apos;s intellectual property
        rights, Pollist, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the
        investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such
        intellectual property infringement claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> You represent and warrant that (i)
        you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government
        embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a
        “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S.
        Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third Party Terms of Agreement:</strong> You must comply with
        applicable third party terms of agreement when using the Licensed
        Application, e.g., if you have a VoIP application, then you must not be
        in violation of their wireless data service agreement when using the
        Licensed Application.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Third Party Beneficiary:</strong> You and Pollist acknowledge
        and agree that Apple, and Apple&apos;s subsidiaries, are third party
        beneficiaries of these Terms, and that, upon your acceptance of the
        terms and conditions of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will
        be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you
        as a third party beneficiary thereof.
